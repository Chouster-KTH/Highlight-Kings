# Project DH2642 - Highlight Kings
## [Highlight Kings on herokuapp](https://highlightkings.herokuapp.com/)
Highlight Kings is a football application which targets football lovers who want an easy and interactive way to enjoy football highlights. The application is simply a web page where users can enjoy football highlights. What makes the application special is that highlights can be upvoted by the users. Users can watch highlights from several countries and leagues and rank them using the upvote button. The most upvoted highlights are displayed in the home page, hence, the users can see if they agree or not with other users. In addition to the leaderboard, one can also choose to watch recent highlights. The website also includes features to list and watch fixtures (whole schedule of games to be played), from pre-selected leagues. With different search options for team and current match status, the user will be able to find a particular match in the current league. Another feature is to see the current standings of one of the pre-selected leagues.   
The user can navigate the site by using the fixed sidebar, to explore the different content.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and and built using React and Node.js.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install Node.js 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
